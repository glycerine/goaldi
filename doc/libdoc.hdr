This is part of the documentation for
http://goaldi.org[The Goaldi Programming Language].

'''

This document lists the procedures and methods present in the
Goaldi standard library.
It was produced mechanically by extracting source code comments.

For each entry, the header line gives the procedure and argument names
followed by a one-line synopsis.
A procedure with a suffix of *[]* in its argument list accepts
an arbitrary number of arguments.
A more detailed procedure description follows the header line.

Some library procedures such as *printf*, *remove*, and *regex*
are just springboards to underlying Go functions.
These are indicated by a link on the header line to the Go function.
Additional documentation of associated types and methods
can be found by following the link.

Extracted descriptions may refer to the Go function and parameter names
rather than those of the intermediate Goaldi procedure.
In general, if any of these Go functions returns an error,
an exception is thrown.

Methods are distinguished from procedures by an inital character and period,
as in *L.put*(...).
The initial character indicates the type of value 
to which the method applies:
====
*x* {nbsp} any value +
*t* {nbsp} type value +
*f* {nbsp} file value +
*c* {nbsp} channel value +
*L* {nbsp} list value +
*S* {nbsp} set value +
*T* {nbsp} table value +
