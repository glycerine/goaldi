= Goaldi Standard Library

This alphabetical listing of standard procedures and methods was auto-extracted
from source code comments.
Methods are distinguished by a preceding type character, as in *L.put*(...);
a type character of *x* indicates a method usable with values of all types.

For each entry, the header line gives the procedure and argument names
followed by a one-line synopsis.
A suffix of *[]* in an argument list indicates
an arbitrary number of arguments.
A more detailed description follows the header line.

Some library procedures such as *printf*, *remove*, and *regex*
are just springboards to underlying Go functions.
These are indicated by a link on the header line to the Go function.
Extracted descriptions may refer to the Go function and parameter names
rather than those of the intermediate Goaldi procedure.

For Go runctions, additional documentation including descriptions
of associated types and methods can be found by following the link.
In general, if any of these Go functions returns an error,
an exception is thrown.
