= Goaldi Standard Library

This listing of standard procedures and methods was auto-extracted
from source code comments.
Procedures appear first, followed by methods associated with standard types.
The first set of methods, with a type code of *x*,
may be used with values of any type.

For each procedure, the header line gives the procedure and argument names
followed by a one-line synopsis.
A suffix of *[]* in the argument list means that the procedure
accepts an arbitrary number of arguments.
The header line is followed by a more detailed description.

Some library procedures such as *printf*, *remove*, and *regex*
are just springboards to underlying Go functions.
These are indicated by a link on the header line to the Go function.
Extracted descriptions may refer to the Go function and parameter names
rather than those of the intermediate Goaldi procedure.

Further descriptions of types and methods associated with the associated
Go package can be found by following the link.
In general, if any of these Go functions returns an error,
an exception is thrown.
