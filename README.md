This initial distribution is intended for a small group
while we shake out the early problems.
Please don't pass it along further.
We anticipate eventual release under an open-source license.


## Requirements
Goaldi should run on any Unix-based platform that supports
[Go](http://golang.org/).
We develop on Macintosh and Linux.

## Documentation
The initial documentation assumes a working knowledge of the Icon language.
