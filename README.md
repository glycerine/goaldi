Goaldi: A New Goal-Directed Programming Language 
=====

Goaldi is a new general-purpose programming language that combines
the goal-directed evaluation model of the
[Icon](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon) language
with modern features such as concurrency, objects, and closures.
While Goaldi will look familiar to Icon programmers,
it is not upwards compatible, and it omits some features of Icon.

This is an initial distribution while we shake out early problems
in design, implementation, and documentation.
We anticipate eventual release under an open-source license.


## Requirements
Goaldi should run on any Unix-based platform that supports
[Go](http://golang.org/).
We develop on Macintosh and Linux.

## Documentation
The initial documentation assumes a working knowledge of the Icon language.
View it using Google Docs:

[Latest "published" version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TazaoECAzgqt0o-bdfvBL5nhMxA_w7KuJN65Cr5ov4M/pub)
with poorer formatting
