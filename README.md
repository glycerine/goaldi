This initial distribution is intended for a small group while we shake out the early problems.  Please don't pass it along further.


## Requirements
Goaldi should run on any platform that supports
[Go 1.2](http://golang.org/),
[Icon 9.5](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/), and a
[Posix shell]
(http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html).
We develop on Macintosh and Linux.
