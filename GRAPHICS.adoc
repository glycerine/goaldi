= Goaldi Graphics Notes

Goaldi graphics support is experimental, incomplete, and
a bit incoherent.
It was developed as an exploratory proof of concept,
not as a final product in any sense.

Graphics code uses external libraries that must be obtained
using Git and Mercurial (the *git* and *hg* commands).
Install these packages first (in addition to the Go language)
if they are not already present.
Then, before building Goaldi, run *make getlibs*
to download and install the necessary external libraries.

The external *golang.org/x/mobile* package mutates rapidly,
repeatedly breaking the Goaldi code.
This version of Goaldi works with
golang.org/x/mobile updated through commit *1F6220*
of August 3, 2015.
