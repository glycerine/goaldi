= Goaldi Graphics Notes

Graphics support is experimental and unstable.
Build failures are quite likely because the
underlying Go libraries are in a state of flux.

The graphics code uses external libraries that must be obtained
using Git and Mercurial (the *git* and *hg* commands).
Install these packages first (in addition to the Go language)
if they are not already present.

Then, before building Goaldi, run *make getlibs*
to download and install the necessary external libraries.

As these libraries change, Goaldi changes in response.
After updating Goaldi, it may be necessary to again run
*make getlibs* to refresh the imported libraries.
