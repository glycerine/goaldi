= Goaldi Graphics Notes

Graphics support is experimental and unstable.
Build failures are quite likely because the
underlying Go libraries are in a state of flux.

Additional installation steps are needed on the graphics code branch.
The graphics code requires external libraries which are obtained using
*go get*.
This command, in turn, requires that the Git and Mercurial packages
(the *git* and *hg* commands) be installed in the search path.
(Note: *hg* may not be needed at this moment, but it will be.)

After downloading Goaldi, and after installing Git and Mercurial, run
	*go get -d -u -a -v goaldi/interp*
to download and install the necessary libraries before building Goaldi.
