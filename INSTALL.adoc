= Installing Goaldi

A binary distribution of Goaldi consists of a single self-contained
executable file named *goaldi* accompanied by a small number of text files,
including the link:./StdLib.adoc[library documentation]
corresponding to the release.

To use the *goaldi* executable,
just leave it in place and add its directory to your search path;
or copy it to your own bin directory;
or copy it somewhere else such as /usr/local.

Run Goaldi with the command *goaldi sourcefile.gd*,
optionally appending any arguments to be passed to the Goaldi program.
