Goaldi Implementation To-Do List

add multipurpose env parameter to procedure call interface

reorganize source tree; what makes sense for a mixed-language project?
straighten out goaldi vs goaldi/terp: what goes where?
make self-contained?  (don't build into ../../bin)

more consistency in struct and procedure names
better & more uniform func header comments
address all the #%#% notes in the code
