Camille Saint-Saëns
(from Wikipedia)

Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor
Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior,
and his wife, Françoise-Clémence, née Collin.
Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry,
and his wife was from a Haute-Marne family;
their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris,
and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice,
always considered himself a true Parisian.
Less than two months after the christening,
Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage.
The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health,
and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil,
29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris.
